    "## The code below was developed by Will Schuster (Carthage College) in May of 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "Some ideas I would like to pursue with modifications to this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Review the derivation that resulted in the frequency equation in the intro paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01940.pdf) and make sure you understand each step. Could I try carrying this derivation out for modified theories of gravity? (get a frequency plot like the one use this code for a modified theory of gravity and see how it differs from GR's derivation... maybe there are regimes (high mass, low eccentricity, etc.) where these deivations are very noticable) \n",
    "   \n",
    "2) Would there be a way to quantify the difference between the GR-generated model and the observed data rather than just doing it by eye? How could we quantify how aligned the models are with the observed data? I'd assume that the real models used by LIGO employ NR methods so they would be much more accurate. Find how to get access to the underlying models for each merger so you can quantify a mismatch between its and your model over frequency space. \n"
